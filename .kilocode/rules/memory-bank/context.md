## Auth Flow

| Step | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| App launch (`/`) | Check Supabase session → login if none, setup if no profile, tabs if ready |
| Sign Up | Email + password (min 8 chars), show/hide toggle, confirm password, email verification message, Privacy Policy + Terms links |
| Login | Email + password, show/hide toggle, rate limit (5 attempts → 15 min lockout), auto-login if session exists |
| Forgot Password | Email input → Supabase `resetPasswordForEmail`, success message |
| Setup | Save name/spouse/wedding date to `profiles` table via `upsertProfile` |
| Sign Out | `supabase.auth.signOut()` → redirect to `/auth/login` |

## Next Steps (Suggested)

- [ ] Implement journal entry CRUD with Supabase
- [ ] Add photo upload to Memory Lane (expo-image-picker + expo-file-system)
- [ ] Add push notification permission request on first launch
- [ ] Add anniversary countdown to profile
- [ ] Add more scripture verses and devotional content
- [ ] Run Supabase schema in dashboard to create tables
